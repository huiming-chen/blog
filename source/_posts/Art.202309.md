消逝的蜃景｜2023
---
##### 單頻道錄像、複合媒材｜尺寸依場地而定

---
這件作品意圖將舊家的靜態影像以AI生成錄像與複合媒材呈現時間及情感性的擴展。錄像部分，使用AI技術，將清空後的舊家、與準備易主而裝潢後的靜態影像匯入，產生詩意、如夢境般的動態內容，希望呈現某種游離於回憶之中的感覺。複合媒材部分，則將舊家的影像黏貼於畫布上，施加各式壓克力技法，像是幻燈片、也像是舊家的殘影永遠被封印在某種類似牆面的肌理之中。

This work intends to use AI-generated video and composite media to show the expansion of time and emotion from the static images of the old home. In the video part, AI technology is used to merge the old home after it has been emptied out, and the static images after it is ready to change ownership and be decorated, to produce poetic and dream-like dynamic content, hoping to present a certain feeling of wandering in memories. For the composite media part, images of the old home are pasted onto the canvas, using various acrylic techniques, like slides, and it seems that the afterimage of the old home is forever sealed in a texture similar to the wall.
